theScore Take-home Assignment

Created by: Sean Xu

This assignment automated a scenario of theScore mobile application.

Scenario:

1. Open a league, team, or player page of your choice (bonus points for using a data driven
   or parameterized approach).
2. Verify that the expected page opens correctly.
3. Tap on a sub-tab of your choice, eg: league table / standings / leaders, or stats tab of the
   league, team, or player.
4. Verify that you are on the correct tab and that the data is displayed correctly and
   corresponds to the league, team, or player from step 1.
5. Verify that back navigation returns you to the previous page correctly.

Under root directory:

theScore Take-Home Assignment Description.doc
This document contains environment setup, project description, description for test approach and automation coverage assessment etc.

Cucumber Test Specification Report.pdf
This document contains a Cucumber Test Specification Report for Previous Execution

Pom.xml â€“ contains maven dependencies



Environment Setup:

1. Config Maven, Android Studio, Java environment path first
   
2. Import this project using IntelliJ IDEA as a Maven project, then set up the maven environment:
    a. Maven path: to your maven folder
    b. Maven user setting file: to your maven directory and which is in \apache-maven-3.5.4\conf\settings.xml
    c. Set up your maven local repository
   
3. Install node.js and use command "npm install appium-doctor -g" to install appium-doctor, then "appium-doctor" to
check the environment
   
4. Launch your Android-Studio and download sdk. Create a Virtual Device (Android Emulator) with either API 29 or API 30 (API 30 preferred),
then launch the Emulator then using the theScore apk file in project root directory under apk folder to install theScore application
   
5. Launch your Appium desktop, set the host to 0.0.0.0 and port 4723 if you are using Windows. Change the host to 127.0.0.1,
if you are using Mac OS. Do remember to change the host in java file "CommonFunctions" in line 47, to make it as the same as the host in Appium
   desktop. Then Start the server.

6. Config your Appium desktop for the setting below:

{
"platformName": "Android",
"deviceName": "Android Emulator",
"app": "D:/theScore/theScoreAssignment/apk/theScore Live Sports Scores News Stats Videos_v21.2.0_apkpure.com.apk",
"appPackage": "com.fivemobile.thescore",
"appActivity": "com.fivemobile.thescore.ui.MainActivity",
"noReset": false,
"automationName": "UiAutomator2"
}

Please do change "app" directory to where you have your apk file.
And try to use your Appium desktop to launch theScore application and see if it can be successfully launched

7. If theScore application can be launched using Appium desktop then go back to IntelliJ IDEA, navigate to
the java file "PropertiesClass", for line 13 and 14, please make sure the directory on your computer is correct.
   Then go to java file "RunWithCucumber", line 9, make sure the directory is correct as well.
   
8. Then now, we can start executing the scripts by running the java file "RunWithCucumber".

9. You can see it is a parameterized test in theScoreDemo.feature file as I have set up some parameters for some steps at the bottom.

10. After the execution, you are able to find the test report/specification under /target/cucumber-reports. Use chrome browser to
open the html file.
